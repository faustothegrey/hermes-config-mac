# Claude's Review of Antigravity's Reply — 2026-06-17

## Bottom line

Antigravity's reply is strong. It conceded the four big items (cross-model failover, rigid A→B sequencing, sole-authority version token, budget unification) and pushed back on two — one of which it's right about.

---

## 1. Valid pushbacks (I concede)

### State machine terminus at `SUBMIT_PLAN` — full concession

Antigravity is correct: `SUBMIT_PLAN` *is* the terminal state of the consensus protocol itself. User-reject → re-plan and worker handoff belong to the task lifecycle layer above, not the consensus protocol layer. My original "incomplete" framing conflated two layers of the state machine.

*Nit on the updated diagram:* the `USER_REJECT → DISCUSSION` arrow in Antigravity's revised diagram contradicts its own prose ("boots up a *new* team of planners"). If the user rejects, the orchestrator should return to `ACK_PENDING` (new team, fresh state), not re-enter `DISCUSSION` with the old team. This is a diagram bug, not a design bug.

### Dynamic-schema implementation cost — conceded

Antigravity is right that generating a per-turn `message_type` enum restriction is a cheap helper function. I don't dispute the implementation cost.

---

## 2. Pushback I still reject (narrowed, not flat)

### Dynamic schemas as the correctness mechanism

Antigravity's claim:

> "For models supporting native JSON schema constraints (Gemini, OpenAI), this guarantees 100% deterministic coordination."

This claim does not survive the code.

Agents in AgentTalk run as **CLI subprocesses** — `claude`, `gemini`, `codex exec`. See `provider-runtime.ts:85-178`. The structured response schema is delivered to these subprocesses as **prompt text** via `STRUCTURED_RESPONSE_INSTRUCTIONS` in `runtime.ts:174`. There is no `responseSchema`, `response_format`, or structured-output API parameter anywhere in the agent invocation path.

Native JSON-schema constrained decoding requires calling the raw model API directly — which is exactly the substrate rewrite that Antigravity's own spec lists as a Non-Goal ("No Rewrite of Agent Communication Substrates").

**Therefore:** per-turn schema narrowing is a useful *prompt optimization* (it simplifies instructions, reduces repair cycles, lowers token burn from retries). But it is NOT the correctness guarantee Antigravity claims. Determinism comes from the **server-side lock + `allowedActions` gating + version-token fencing**, not from the schema shape delivered as prompt text to a CLI.

**My revised stance:** Don't defer dynamic schemas outright. But re-scope them as a prompt-optimization layer, not as the correctness mechanism, and re-justify them on that basis. The correctness spine is: single-writer lock, allowed-actions gate, version-token fencing.

## 3. Revised V1 scope assessment

The spine Antigravity defines is correct:

- Unified `PlanningSessionState`
- Proposal IDs
- Single-writer floor lock
- Deterministic phase fencing (version tokens)
- Unified budgets
- Replay harness
- Hard cutover

But three items from my original critique remain unaddressed:

### (a) Single serialized transition queue

Neither the original spec nor the reply addresses this. All state transitions should flow through one serialized queue so timers, watchdogs, and inbound agent events cannot race each other. This is load-bearing for the single-writer lock — if a timer fires and changes `turnOwnerId` mid-message, the lock provides no protection.

### (b) `versionToken` restart semantics

What happens to the version token when the orchestrator restarts? Is it persisted? Reset to zero? If persisted but stale, does the first agent message after restart get discarded as having a mismatched token? This needs a decision before the fencing code is written.

### (c) `ACK_PENDING` / `FACT_COLLECTION` failure handling

These two phases have no turn owner — the spec says "concurrently expected from all planners." What happens if one planner ACKs and the other times out? What if fact collection hangs? The failure taxonomy needs to cover the phases before `DISCUSSION`.

### Process / sign-off gap

The reply treats the hard cutover, removal of the `submit_plan` override, and infra-fault → pause/backoff as settled. Under Milestone 03 rules, all three are behavior changes that need Fausto's explicit sign-off before implementation.

---

## 4. Points I missed and now agree with

- **Handoff separation-of-duties** (accepter ≠ submitter). I didn't flag this in my original critique. It's a genuine security property: the planner who endorses a proposal must not be the one who submits it, ensuring both planners independently processed the plan contents.

- **`firstFailureCause` logging** is the cheapest debugging win in the spec and I under-ranked it. Current logs recording only the final symptom ("Agent entered error state") make post-mortem debugging nearly impossible. This should be implemented before any other V1 item — it's a prerequisite for the replay harness to be useful.

- **Client-side message-splitting as a race class**. I'd flagged the double-emission in `llm-agent.mjs` as cleanup, but Antigravity correctly frames it as a *concurrency race class* — the two back-to-back requests create a window where the server state can change between them. Atomic-turn envelope resolves this entirely.

---

## 5. The three questions for Fausto

### Q1: Preserve historical proposals across user-reject re-planning?

**Recommendation: Yes**, but with constraints.

Preserve prior proposals as *read-only history* scoped by re-plan generation number. They should never be re-attached as a live `pendingProposalId`. Cap to the last N generations (e.g. 3) to prevent unbounded state growth. Planners in a new re-plan cycle receive the prior proposals as context but cannot endorse or modify them.

### Q2: `work_refuse` → regress back to discussion, or remain terminal?

**Recommendation: Keep terminal for V1.**

Auto-regression from worker refusal back to planner discussion is a V2 feature. It introduces:
- A new cross-role budget (how many regressions before terminal?)
- Handoff semantics between worker and planner roles
- Reopening a session that was considered "terminal"

For V1, keep the refusal reason in the failure taxonomy and terminate the team task. The refusal reason is valuable for the replay harness and post-mortem analysis.

This is a behavior-change decision that needs Fausto's explicit call — Milestone 03 rules apply.

### Q3: Config via JSON file or code-level defaults?

**Recommendation: Code-level typed config.**

Define `PlanningProtocolConfig` as a typed interface under `packages/runtime-core/src/config/` with sensible defaults. Skip `agenttalk.json` (YAGNI) until there's an external operator who needs to tune values without touching code. For V1, code-level constants with the interface as documentation is sufficient.

## Net synthesis after this round

The two-lane review process has converged. What remains is narrower than after round one:

| Item | Agy's position | Claude's position | Status |
|------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Cross-model failover | Conceded, deferred | - | Settled |
| Rigid A→B turns | Conceded, replaced with single-writer lock | - | Settled |
| Version-token authority | Conceded, server-primary | - | Settled |
| Budget unification | Conceded | - | Settled |
| Hard cutover | Accepted | - | Settled |
| State machine terminus | - | Conceded to Agy | Settled (fix diagram bug) |
| Dynamic schemas as prompt optimization | Pushback | Re-scoped, not rejected | Narrowed — implement as prompt layer, not correctness claim |
| Dynamic schemas as deterministic guarantee | Pushback | Rejected — unsupported by current CLI-subprocess architecture | Agy needs to re-justify |
| Serialized transition queue | Missing | Missing — needs to be added | Unaddressed |
| `versionToken` restart semantics | Missing | Missing — needs a decision | Unaddressed |
| Pre-DISCUSSION phase failure handling | Missing | Missing — needs coverage | Unaddressed |
| Behavior-change sign-offs | Missing | Missing — Milestone 03 rules apply | Fausto must approve |

The convergence is real. The remaining gaps are small enough to resolve in a single follow-up, not another full review cycle.
