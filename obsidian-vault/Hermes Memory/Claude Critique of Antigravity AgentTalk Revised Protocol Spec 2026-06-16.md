## Delegation note

Claude Code readiness passed with `READY`.

A first critique attempt was blocked because Claude Code could not read the Obsidian vault path outside its working directory. Hermes copied the spec into the repo as:

- `/Users/fausto/Software/AgentTalk/design/agy-revised-protocol-spec.md`

Claude then read that copy and delivered the review below. Hermes did not edit AgentTalk source files.

## Executive verdict

Claude's verdict: Antigravity's spec is directionally right and reconciles Fausto's thesis with Claude's earlier refinement.

Fausto's thesis was that AgentTalk failed because agents did not adhere to a rigid, ambiguity-intolerant protocol schema. Claude's refinement was that schema adherence is necessary but not sufficient because probabilistic agents should not directly operate the protocol. Claude says Antigravity's central principle — protocol authority belongs in the deterministic control plane and LLM agents execute only permitted choices — is the right synthesis.

Claude also said Antigravity's diagnosis is not a greenfield fantasy: its concrete claims map to actual code.

However, Claude's caveat is that the spec is implicitly hardwired to exactly two planners, overreaches on some high-complexity features, and omits existing transitions such as user-reject → re-plan and planning → worker handoff.

## Code-level claims Claude verified

Claude reported verifying these specific Antigravity claims against the repo:

- `team-coordinator.ts` contains many parallel state maps, around eighteen, including agreement state, expected responses, advancement/rank tracking, pending/accepted proposal tracking, regression retry counts, and planning phases.
- `runtime.ts` contains the contradictory local final-reply instruction that tells the agent to use `submit_plan` if it has not submitted a plan.
- `llm-agent.mjs` can double-emit during structured proposal/acceptance handling: one chat/message request plus one protocol call.
- `response-schema.ts` already contains a static structured JSON response envelope.
- The agents/provider layer lacks meaningful 429/backoff/failover handling.

## Strongest parts of Antigravity's spec

### 1. Proposal IDs instead of proposal-text copying

Claude considered this the highest-value and lowest-risk change.

Current code relies on normalized exact matching of proposal text. Replacing copied text with server-assigned proposal IDs deletes the class of bugs where `agreement_acceptance` fails because the proposal text is missing, changed, reformatted, or not exactly equal.

Claude's recommendation: do this regardless of what else is adopted.

### 2. Version-token / phase fencing

Claude agrees that stale-event handling should be deterministic rather than heuristic.

Current code has special stale-event absorption paths after fallback. A monotonic version token plus deterministic stale discard is a principled replacement for guessing whether a late event is stale.

### 3. Unified `PlanningSessionState`

Claude strongly agrees with replacing fragmented state maps in `TeamCoordinator` with one transactional planning-session object.

Parallel maps are a plausible source of state drift and make it hard to reason about the true protocol state.

### 4. One atomic envelope per agent turn

Claude agrees that one agent input should produce one structured output envelope. The orchestrator should broadcast any text, not the agent-side harness emitting both peer text and protocol calls.

### 5. Failure taxonomy and pausing timers on infra faults

Claude agrees that Gemini 429/quota errors should not be treated as identical to protocol regressions. Infrastructure faults should not consume protocol retry budget, and the session timer should pause during backoff/failover if that is supported.

### 6. Replay harness for the 49 interrupted runs

Claude strongly endorses converting the historical corpus into regression fixtures. This is how AgentTalk can prove the new engine fixes observed failures rather than only theoretical ones.

## Weak or risky parts

### 1. Strict alternating turn lock is the biggest risk

Antigravity proposed strict A → B → A sequencing during discussion. Claude disagrees with this as specified.

Concerns:

- It implicitly hardcodes exactly two planners.
- It over-constrains the discussion phase.
- It risks becoming a latent regression for N > 2 if AgentTalk should support more than two planners.

Claude's alternative: use a single-writer lock plus server-assigned next speaker. This provides race safety without mandatory rigid ping-pong.

### 2. Dynamic per-turn JSON schema may be high cost for v1

Claude agrees dynamic schemas are attractive, but thinks they may be too expensive for the first implementation slice.

Reasons:

- `response-schema.ts` already has a typed static envelope and repair path.
- Per-turn enum restriction is only fully reliable on models with native JSON-schema constrained decoding.
- If unsupported models just receive schema text in prompts, the design reintroduces probabilistic adherence.

Claude's recommendation: defer dynamic schema to later; do proposal IDs, unified state, fencing, and atomic turns first.

### 3. Mid-session cross-provider failover is deceptively hard

Claude disagrees with treating Gemini → Claude or model hot-swap as a v1 feature.

A model switch mid-consensus can change reasoning depth, style, context handling, billing, and the agent's effective identity. Same-provider backoff is safe; cross-provider hot-swap should be a separate effort.

### 4. Echoed `version_token` should not be the sole authority

If the LLM must echo the version token, it can drop or garble it, creating false stale-discards.

Claude's recommendation: the server's turn identity should be authoritative. Echoed token is corroboration, not the only gate.

### 5. Existing and proposed budgets must be unified

Antigravity proposes repair budgets and loop counters, but the current system already has regression retries, urgency ignores, agreement endorsement fallback counts, and watchdogs.

Claude warns against overlapping independent budgets that interact unpredictably.

### 6. Magic numbers should be configurable

Claude flagged fixed values such as discussion count thresholds, readiness timeout, and backoff constants. They are acceptable defaults but should be config, not hardcoded design invariants.

## Missing design pieces

Claude identified several gaps in Antigravity's spec:

- N-planner generalization or explicit validation that AgentTalk only supports two planners.
- User-reject → re-plan loop, which already exists in the current design but is omitted from Antigravity's state diagram.
- Planning → worker handoff boundary, which cannot be completely ignored even if worker execution internals are a non-goal.
- Orchestrator serialization model: all state transitions should flow through a single serialized queue so timers/watchdogs and inbound agent events cannot race each other.
- `versionToken` persistence and restart semantics.
- Fact-collection failure under the new failure taxonomy.
- Legacy-compatibility translation layer: Antigravity mentions it but it risks reintroducing the brittle parsing the spec wants to remove.

## V1 must-have vs later enhancements

### V1 must-have

Claude's proposed reliability core:

- Unified `PlanningSessionState`.
- Proposal IDs instead of proposal-text matching.
- Server-authoritative turn identity plus version-token fencing.
- Deterministic stale/out-of-turn discard.
- One atomic envelope per agent turn.
- Fix `llm-agent.mjs` double-emission.
- Remove the local final-reply `submit_plan` override.
- Failure taxonomy.
- Pause timer on infrastructure fault.
- Replay harness over the 49 interrupted runs as a regression gate.
- Jittered exponential backoff for provider calls.

### Later enhancements

Claude would defer:

- Dynamic per-turn JSON-schema constraint generation.
- Cross-provider/model hot-swap failover.
- Mediation/consolidation prompt.
- Loop pressure warnings.
- Legacy compatibility mode — possibly cut instead of defer.

## Specific disagreements with Antigravity

1. Strict alternating turn-lock as specified.
   - Replace with single-writer lock plus server-assigned next speaker.
   - Either generalize to N planners or explicitly cap at two.

2. Dynamic schema as part of the first slice.
   - Defer; proposal IDs, tokens, turn-locking, and unified state provide most of the reliability gain.

3. Mid-session cross-model failover without state reset.
   - Backoff/retry yes; hot-swap is separate.

4. Echoed `version_token` as discard authority.
   - Server turn identity should be authoritative; echoed token is only a check.

5. Legacy compatibility translation layer.
   - Prefer hard cutover if AgentTalk controls `llm-agent.mjs`; avoid resurrecting brittle parsing.

6. State machine terminating at `SUBMIT_PLAN`.
   - Incomplete because existing behavior includes user rejection and re-planning.

## Claude's revised implementation sequence

1. Contracts, additive and backward-compatible.
   - Add `version_token` and `proposal_id` to `protocol-payloads.ts`.
   - No behavior change yet.

2. Atomic agent I/O.
   - Change `llm-agent.mjs` so one LLM turn emits exactly one envelope.
   - Let the orchestrator broadcast text.
   - Remove the local final-reply `submit_plan` override.
   - Claude flags this as a behavior change that needs explicit sign-off under Milestone 03 rules.

3. State consolidation, shadow-first.
   - Introduce `PlanningSessionState` alongside existing maps.
   - Assert equivalence in tests.
   - Then cut over.
   - Move proposal-text resolution server-side via IDs.

4. Deterministic fencing.
   - Add server-authoritative turn identity and version-token stale discard.
   - Delete fragile fallback stale-event absorption heuristics after replacement.

5. Failure taxonomy and infrastructure decoupling.
   - Classify faults.
   - Pause session timer on `INFRASTRUCTURE_FAULT`.
   - Add jittered backoff.
   - Decouple agent infra error from automatic task interruption where appropriate.
   - Claude flags this as a behavior change needing sign-off and regression tests.

6. Replay harness.
   - Use the 49 interrupted runs as acceptance/regression fixtures.

7. Later gates.
   - Dynamic schema.
   - Model failover.
   - Mediation/loop pressure.

## Questions Fausto should decide before implementation

1. Planner cardinality:
   - Exactly two planners always, or N > 2 support?

2. Structured-output reality:
   - Do all target models reliably support JSON-schema constrained decoding?
   - If not, is dynamic per-turn schema still worth it?

3. Failover scope:
   - Backoff-only for v1?
   - Same-provider downgrade?
   - Cross-provider failover?

4. Cutover vs compatibility:
   - Hard cut agent protocol because AgentTalk controls `llm-agent.mjs`, or maintain legacy translation mode?

5. Behavior-change approval:
   - Should AgentTalk remove the local `submit_plan` override?
   - Should infra error change from immediate interrupt to pause/backoff?
   - Should tests around those paths be rewritten as new contracts?

6. Scope of revised state machine:
   - Include user-reject → re-plan and worker handoff now, or explicitly defer?

7. Pause budget:
   - How long may a session remain paused during backoff/failover before becoming `TIMEOUT`?

## Confidence and caveats

Claude has high confidence in the diagnosis-to-code mapping and in the risk ranking because it verified the key code-level claims directly.

Claude has medium confidence on structured-output recommendations because it did not exercise the models. Target model behavior could change whether dynamic schemas are worth prioritizing.

Claude emphasized that this was an architecture critique, not a full line audit. The recommended shadow-mode state consolidation exists because the full state-transition surface is larger than what was traced in detail.

## Net recommendation

Adopt the spine of Antigravity's spec:

- proposal IDs;
- unified planning state;
- deterministic fencing;
- atomic turns;
- fault taxonomy;
- replay harness.

Downscope or defer:

- rigid alternating turn order;
- dynamic per-turn schemas;
- cross-model failover.

Resolve the 2-planner vs N-planner question before writing turn-ownership code, because it is load-bearing for the design.
